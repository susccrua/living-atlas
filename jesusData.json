Mary then became pregnant by the Holy Spirit though this not the same as mythological gods impregnanting humans. This was required as it seems that the sinful nature was passed down through the father. This allowed Jesus to be fully human but not born into sin.* ",

There was also the prophecy of Balaam in Numbers 24:17 that mentions a star coming out of Jacob, also known as Isreal. Also, nothing stats that there were three wisemen but just three gifts.",

Funny enough when Jesus returns from Egypt with his family because Herod is now dead He fulfilled the Messianic prophecy in Hosea 11:1 that Jesus will come out of Egypt. So Herod''s selfish and scared attempt to kill Jesus, a new king, was used by God. Throughout Jesus' life it parrells what that nation of Isreal has gone through after God leads them out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses. ",

In shock, they turned back and spent three days looking for Jesus. On the third day they found Jesus teaching in the temple and they were in distraught. People listening to Jesus were astonished about what this 12 year old understood and his answers. Jesus' parents questioned why he was at the temple. Jesus respond sincerly and amazed, \"Why were you looking for me? Did you now know that I must be in my Father's house?\" But he was obedient to His parents and went with them back to Nazareth",
